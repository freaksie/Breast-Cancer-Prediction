# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
The logistic regression based ML system that predicts whether person have a breast cancer or not. It's an system without any libraries like tensorflow or keras that provide direct implementation by calling a function, This project shows core methodology used behind ML
I learned about how machine tries to find function classifying data based on algorithm of logistic regression and gradient decent. I also learned that machine can perform on non linear datasets too, 

Web Based integration also provided thats using flask.
