# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
The logistic regression based ML system that predicts whether person have a breast cancer or not. It's an system without any libraries like tensorflow or keras that provide direct implementation by calling a function, This project shows core methodolgy used behind ML
I learned about how machine tries to find function classifying data based on algorithm of logistic regression and gradient decent. I also learned that machine can perform on non linear datasets too, because of non-linear activation function we are using. Thus activation function not only provide threshold but also to provide non linearity to output function
